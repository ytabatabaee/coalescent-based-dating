## Coalescent-based dating datasets

This repository contains the datasets and scripts used in the following paper:

For experiments in this study, we generated three sets of simulated datasets with gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and analyzed two avian biological datasets from [Harvey et. al. (2020)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz6970) and [Stiller et. al. (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07323-1). All datasets are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fwU1Nc6BtzvXqQ1KYWPmkZqpC5w3c6_s?usp=sharing).
